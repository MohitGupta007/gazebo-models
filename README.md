# gazebo-models

Make sure you have Gazebo installed on your computer. I have used Gazebo 9 while making this repository. 
Copy the models to your Gazebo model path. In my case the file path is "/usr/share/gazebo-9/models".

To use the urban city world, open the terminal and navigate to the folder containing the urban_city.world file.
To launch the file in Gazebo:
'''
$ gazebo urban_city.world
'''
